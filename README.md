## Overview
This is a simple program that takes a text file as input, and will continuously
randomly ask questions until you get them all correct!

## Running the program
You need stack installed on your machine to run this, and to run it type:
`stack run`.

## Adding text files
### Directory
To add flashcard files to choose from, add them to your `resources` directory.

### Formatting the text file
The text file should have the following format
- Questions on even lines
- Answers on the succeeding (odd) line

We have added a sample file in `resources/sample.txt` to give an example of
this.
